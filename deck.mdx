Presented By Michael Chris Lopez

## About Me

-   Michael Chris Lopez

-   BS of Computer Science

-   Software Engineer

<Notes>

-   Graduate of SLU way back 2013
-   Coming from a Web Development background

</Notes>

---

<Dart />

## Dart

---

### Entry Point

<Highlighter code={snippets.main} />

<Notes>

-   Entry point
-   Unlike JavaScript that doesn't have an entry point
-   Similar to Java and C#

</Notes>

---

### Variables

<Highlighter code={snippets.variables} />

<Notes>

-   Type safe
-   Type inferences, don't have to specify explicitly the type
-   It's very similar to JavaScript
-   A little history, Dart was meant to be replacement to JavaScript back when
    JavaScript was not a very good language to use

</Notes>

---

### Control Flow

<Highlighter code={snippets.controlFlow1} />

<Notes>

-   Control Flow as usual
-   Very similar to other OOP languages

</Notes>

---

### Control Flow

<Highlighter code={snippets.controlFlow2} />

<Notes>

-   Control Flow as usual

</Notes>

---

### Functions

<Highlighter code={snippets.functions} />

<Notes>

-   Example is demonstrating recursion
-   Coming from JavaScript, my favorite part of the language are functions
-   Type safety, return type needs a type
-   Arrow function for anonymous functions useful for passing as arguments
-   Learn more about optional parameters, default values, lexical scope etc

</Notes>

---

### Imports

<Highlighter code={snippets.imports} />

<Notes>

-   For organizing your code in several logical files
-   Essential for scaling your application
-   You can of course write it all in the `main.dart` file but that's just crazy

</Notes>

---

### Classes

<Highlighter code={snippets.classes} />

<Notes>

-   Inheritance
-   Coming from JS, I much prefer Functional rather than OO
-   And much more, e.g. Abstract classes
-   Mixins which is similar to Traits to other languages

</Notes>

---

### Async

<Highlighter code={snippets.futures} />

</small>

<Notes>

-   If you are coming from JS, this is equivalent to the async/await functions
-   Futures are Promises in JS
-   Being adapted by languages now
-   Easier to reason with vs callback hell, promise hell

## Flutter

---

### Hello World

<Highlighter code={snippets.helloWorld} />

<Notes>

-   The most basic setup for a Flutter app
-   Render tree
-   Composable and Declarative vs Imperative

</Notes>

---

### Widgets

-   Flutter's building block
-   Inspired by React's Components.
-   Declarative UI Programming

<Highlighter code={snippets.widgets} />

<Notes>

-   vs Imperative UI Programming e.g. jQuery
-   History of React adoption
    -   Used to separate HTML, JavaScript and CSS
    -   Now combines HTML and JavaScript together through JSX

</Notes>

## Summary

### Dart

-   UI optimized programming language
-   Type safe
-   Familiar syntax (OOP)

### Flutter

-   Cross-platform
-   Declarative UI
-   Native Performance
-   Opinionated out-of-box experience
    -   Built-in Material Design widgets
    -   Development experience
        -   Android Studio/VS Code
        -   Testing/Linting
        -   Autocompletion
        -   Dependencies/Package Manager

<Notes>

-   Java and JavaScript inspired
-   Object Orient
-   Due to the language runtime design, supports hot code reloading seamlessly
-   Web development via JavaScript transpiling
-   Due to familiar language, getting into it is quick. And for that reason, the
    community can grow quickly especially people who came from similar language.
    e.g. JavaScript community

</Notes>

### Limitations

<Notes>

-   Personal opinions here
-   Still very new, active in development
-   Small community and resources
-   Low amount of third-party libraries, you'll have to write your own if
    doesn't exists
-   Have to learn a new language
-   Infrastructure is still in pretty early stages
-   Despite that, everything is very promising
