### Variables

<Highlighter code={snippets.variables} />

<Notes>

-   Type safe
-   Type inferences, don't have to specify explicitly the type
-   It's very similar to JavaScript
-   A little history, Dart was meant to be replacement to JavaScript back when
    JavaScript was not a very good language to use
